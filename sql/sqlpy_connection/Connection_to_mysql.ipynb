    "# python\n",
    "# Copy\n",
    "# Edit\n",
    "# cursor.execute(f\"insert into pysqldb.glassdata values({str(i[0])})\")\n",
    "# If you wrote:\n",
    "\n",
    "# python\n",
    "# Copy\n",
    "# Edit\n",
    "# cursor.execute(f\"insert into pysqldb.glassdata values({i[0]})\")\n",

    "\n",
    "# But here's the catch — inside an f-string, if i[0] is already a string, Python will not automatically wrap it in quotes unless you do it yourself.\n",

    "\n",
    "# sql\n",
    "# Copy\n",
    "# Edit\n",
    "# insert into pysqldb.glassdata values(1,2,3,4,5)\n",

    "# Copy\n",
    "# Edit\n",
    "# i[0] = \"1,2,3,'Window',4\"\n",
    "# Then SQL will error out, because it needs quotes around strings properly — and your single big string might break SQL syntax if not formatted correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ So why use str(i[0])?\n",
    "# Actually, in this case:\n",
    "\n",
    "# python\n",
    "# Copy\n",
    "# Edit\n",

    "# For clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Or mistakenly thinking it's needed.\n",

    "# But this is not safe for real SQL inserts, because it doesn’t escape or format the values correctly.\n",
