Tied distances are broken by preferring the larger index value.\\n        tolerance : optional \\n            Maximum distance between original and new labels for inexact matches. The values of the index at the matching locations must satisfy the equation abs(index[indexer] - target) <= tolerance.\\n\\n            Tolerance may be a scalar value, which applies the same tolerance to all values, or list-like, which applies variable tolerance per element. List-like includes list, tuple, array, Series, and must be the same size as the index and its dtype must exactly match the index’s type.\\n\\n        Returns\\n        -------\\n        slice\\n```\\n\\n### Alternative Solutions\\n\\nCurrently I\\'ve effectively written a custom version of `.slice_indexer` that calls `.get_indexer` on the start and end bounds, but I\\'m worried that doing this downstream will miss edge cases compared to solving it upstream in pandas.\\n\\n### Additional Context\\n\\nThis would be nice for use within the internals of xarray\\'s `.sel()` methods.
